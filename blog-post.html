        <p>
          Have you ever heard the phrase, “content is king”? Though content marketing used to just be a way to set
          yourself apart from your competitors, it has now become a necessity for any modern brand. Content marketing is
          at the heart of most successful digital marketing campaigns. Behind every great brand is a wealth of valuable
          and relevant content that really connects with the company’s audience. But you may still be wondering, why is
          content marketing important?</p>

        <p>To help you better understand the importance of content marketing, we’ve put together a list of the top
          advantages that content marketing can provide your small business:</p>

        <p> <strong> 1. Improve brand reputation by building trust through content marketing.</strong></p>
        <p>
          One of the greatest benefits that really shows the importance of content marketing is the reputation building
          qualities of great content. In today’s busy digital marketplace, it’s vital that businesses work to build
          trust
          with their leads and customers. Building trust can help your business establish a positive brand reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great content can help you build trust with your leads and customers. When consumers read your content, they
          start to develop an opinion of your brand. If the content that they find is engaging, educational, and
          valuable, then they will start to think the same things about your business. The more value you can provide
          with your content, the easier it will be to build trust with your target audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, when your leads and customers start to see that you are consistently publishing content across
          platforms, they may come to see you as a leader in the industry. Publishing content through third-party
          publications or sharing your content with influencers can also help you further build trust within your target
          market.
        </p>
        <p><strong> 2. Great content helps influence conversions.</strong></p>

        <p> If you’re really wondering why is content marketing important, then look no further than the conversion
          statistics. Here are just a few of the stats that really speak to the importance of content marketing when it
          comes to improving website conversions:
