      <p> <strong>Who Should You Analyze as Competitors in Digital Marketing?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Competitor analysis normally includes your direct and indirect competitors — those providing the same (or
        similar) solutions to the same (or similar) audiences.

        Online competitor analysis should cover them, plus one more group of rivals: your brand competitors that fight
        for the same users you do. They don’t necessarily need to sell them a similar product or service, but they
        definitely want to get their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why You Need an Ongoing Competitor Analysis in Digital Marketing?
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, when your leads and customers start to see that you are consistently publishing content across
        platforms, they may come to see you as a leader in the industry. Publishing content through third-party
        publications or sharing your content with influencers can also help you further build trust within your target
        market.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why You Need an Ongoing Competitor Analysis in Digital Marketing?</strong></p>
      <p>Your main competitors are most likely to stay the same as when you developed the strategy, but their positions
        and the general situation in the market may change.
        Here are the key reasons to check up on other market players on a regular basis.</p>


      <p><strong> To Review Benchmarks</strong></p>

      <p>From monitoring your internal stats, you know which channels perform the best — but what if your competitors
        have managed to achieve even better results? You need to know it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>To Catch Up with Industry and Market Trends</strong></p>
      <p> There are some seasonal trends that reoccur every year — and there are peaks and declines in demand that you
        will be prepared for only if you monitor the competitive landscape. Make sure to stay alert.

        To Learn the Best New Practices and Mistakes to Avoid
        Sometimes it is better to let your competitors test new channels than go there yourself and waste the budget.
        Learn from other companies' experiences.

      </p>

      <p><strong> To Update Your Marketing Mix</strong></p>
      <p>From digital marketing campaigns, you can get some important news on your competition, such as a new product
        launch, and get ideas for your company’s development.</p>

      <p><strong>To Refine Your Goals</strong></p>

      <p> As the situation in the online market changes, you may need to adjust not just the strategy, but the
        objectives you previously set. </p>
