        <p> Like the control of pay per click advertising, but want
          something more cost-effective than Google Ads (previously
          AdWords)? Try a hyper-targeted ad campaign on Facebook! Why?
          Because Facebook accounts for one in every six minutes spent
          online and one in every five minutes spent on mobile</p>

      <p> The structure of a Facebook advertising campaign consists of three levels: a campaign, an ad set, and an ad.
        The first level, the campaign, is the basis of your ad.</p>
      <p>At the campaign level, you choose your objective, which is the action you want people to take when they see
        your ads. Facebook has three objective categories: Awareness, Consideration, and Conversion. The objective you
        select depends on your strategy. For example, suppose you have a content-first strategy. Because video is
        currently the most effective type of Facebook content, you could run specific campaigns with the Video Views
        objective.

        If you want to run a retargeting campaign to send people from Facebook to your website, choose either the
        Traffic or Conversions objective, depending on what specific action you want people to take.

        The best way to determine your campaign objective is to work backward from your goal. If your goal is to
        generate sales for your ecommerce business, for example, you could offer people 10% off of their first order to
        entice them to make a purchase.
        Instead of giving away the discount code in your ad creative, send people from Facebook to a landing page where
        they have to opt in before receiving the discount code. Because you want people to take a specific action,
        Conversions is the most appropriate campaign objective.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Build Your Ideal Custom Audience</strong></p>
      <p>The second stage in the campaign structure is the ad set, which specifies how your ad will run. Targeting is
        one of the most important elements of your campaign and it can make or break performance, even before your
        campaign goes live. Let’s look at three ways to define your audience.

        Target Demographics and Interests

        The easiest way to target your audience is to use the demographic and interest options. This approach is
        generally used to target new people who haven’t previously interacted with your business.

        Here you’ll choose demographic constraints such as location, age, gender, and language. In the Detailed
        Targeting section, you can narrow your audience by choosing from thousands of interests, behaviors,
        demographics, and more. There’s no rule for how large your target audience should be. Typically you’ll get the
        best results with basic targeting by using a layered approach. Choose a mixture of interests and behaviors to
        zero in on your ideal customer.

        For example, suppose you’re a luxury retailer in the wedding industry. Start by targeting people interested in
        weddings and things related to weddings.
